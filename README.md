# Kerning-templates
Templates to help you when you are kerning your typefaces.

## How to use
There are two ways of using those kerning templates.

1. Copy and paste the contents of the files into InDesing and apply our typeface, adjust kerning, reproduce adjustments in FontLab, Glyphs, Fontographer, RoboFont or which ever font editor you are using.

2. Copy and paste line by line into the metrics windows of FontLab, Glyphs, Fontographer, RoboFont or which ever font editor you are using and adjust kering there.
