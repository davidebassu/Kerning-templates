# Kerning-templates
Lists of character combinations to help you when you kern typefaces.

## How to use
There are two ways of using those kerning templates.

1. Copy and paste the contents of the files into InDesign and apply our typeface, adjust kerning, reproduce adjustments in FontLab, Glyphs, Fontographer, RoboFont or which ever font editor you are using.

2. Copy and paste line by line into the metrics windows of FontLab, Glyphs, Fontographer, RoboFont or which ever font editor you are using and adjust kerning there.
